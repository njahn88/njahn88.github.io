                Arkham Knight Intro Design Analysis

                You are Magnus Carlson, a world renown chess player, getting ready to start
                a tournament. For the first match of the tournament you are paired against an opponent with
                20 years less experience than you. You sit down at the chess board, shake hands, and the match
                starts, but for some reason you can't remember what the pieces do anymore. The opponent makes their
                move and a person from over your shoulder reminds you how to move a pawn. It would leave the chess world
                in shock. You might still win eventually, but the headlines everywhere would read "Former World Chess Champion
                , Magnus Carlson, forgets how to play chess!". This doesn't make sense. This wouldn't happen. So why does
                Batman Arkham Knight start off in the exact same way.

                Just after the intro cutscene and brief stint of gameplay, you are Batman, a crime fighting master, someone who
                has put countless villans away time after time. You drop into a pack of grunts and for some reason you can't remember
                how to punch, counter, or dodge. Most players who are new to the series will likely resort to mashing their controller, hoping
                they hit the right button at the right time. This lack of true understanding could lead to frustration to a point where they might
                not want to continue playing a game where they are supposed to FEEL like Batman. This is why I will be giving my thoughts on what
                Rocksteady could have done to teach the player the core mechanics of the game before throwing them into the fire.

                What makes a great intro?

                The intro of any video game might just be the most important half an hour a developer has to make a good impression
                on the player. It's not easy, but if done well can make the transition from "tutorial" to actual gameplay nearly
                imperceptible. This is what you want. No text boxes that take up the entire screen explaining everything an enemy
                is about to do. No sections of games that are actually marked "Tutorial". All of this can lead players to feel like they
                are in a class...

                It doesn't make any sense and you would fail. Games shouldn't do this. Games are a form of entertainment, not a sit down
                lecture. With all that said it doesn't mean that games can't have text or clearly laid out "Tutorials" it's just that
                there are better and more seamless ways of giving the player the same information.

                What Arkham Knight's intro gets right
            </div>
            <div className={'flex justify-start px-10 md:px-100 py-5 font-outfit'}>
                The intro of Arkham Knight sets up the atmosphere really well and teaches the player how to
                glide around the city. It tells the player how to glide and puts them in an area where even
                if the player messes up and falls, they won't be punished. This allows the player to get comfortable
                with a mechanic they are immediately introduced to without the risk of losing, reducing the potential
                for frustration. Another thing the intro does well is reducing the time the player has to wait before
                getting into the gameplay. There are a lot of games that will use the beginning of a game to "lore" dump,
                pushing the gameplay further and making the player wait to actually play the game.
