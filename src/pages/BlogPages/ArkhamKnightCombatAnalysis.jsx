                Imagine. You are Magnus Carlson, a world renown chess player, getting ready to start
                a tournament. For the first match of the tournament you are paired against an opponent with
                20 years less experience than you. You sit down at the chess board, shake hands, and the match
                starts, but for some reason you can't remember what the pieces do anymore. The opponent makes their
                move and a person from over your shoulder reminds you how to move a pawn. It would leave the chess world
                in shock. You might still win eventually, but the headlines everywhere would read "Former World Chess Champion
                , Magnus Carlson, forgets how to play chess!". This doesn't make sense. This wouldn't happen. So why does
                Batman Arkham Knight start off in the exact same way.

                Just after the intro cutscene and brief stint of gameplay, you are Batman, a crime fighting master, someone who
                has put countless villans away time after time. You drop into a pack of grunts and for some reason you can't remember
                how to punch, counter, or dodge. You turn to mashing the controller hoping that something will work. For most players
                that do this you will succeed. The developers made it so it was very, very difficult to lose this fight and for good reason.
                The problem is that for a lot of players who might not have played any Arkham games before this doesn't help them FEEL like
                Batman and is why I will be giving my thoughts on what Rocksteady could have done to teach the player the core mechanics of the
                game before throwing them into the fire.
